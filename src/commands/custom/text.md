So, basically a system that does the following
- uses custom item "Dice" (done already)
- Able to send to user(s) but user(s) can not buy from shop (done via sendreward module)
- Public leaderboard for item (not currently done)
- a way to export via file/sheets (excel)/pdf (not currently done)
- a way to remove items from all/specific user
 - or use "dice" as currency to get other items

Does that sum it up?
