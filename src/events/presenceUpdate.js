     *  #How this works:
     *  Record user last_login by their last offline presence. If presenceUpdate is occurred two times 
     *  under 2 minutes from the same user, then ignore the entry.
     * 
     *  #Idea to improve this framework:
     *  I wanted to store them in a "queue" model for performance reason but still unsure how to implement it.
     *  So like put the 5-10 users on first queue and run the query later. This also tend to
     *  reduce the need to call database api.
